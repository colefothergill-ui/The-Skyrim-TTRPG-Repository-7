  "backstory": "**Civil War Entry**: Oskern\u2019s Response: \u201cMy Father, Lord Elitrigg Cindershroud, and my Mother, Lady Audania of Cyrodil, entered me into a raffle called life. Just a jest, but only just. As the heir to Clan Cindershroud and son of the Legendary War Hero, the Dragon of Hjaalmarch, when war broke out, it was inevitable that I would end up in it. The short of it is that I was once Thane of Solitude by the age of 18, accepted and assessed as an Adept of the College of Winterhold at 23, and watched my best friend High King Torygg die at 25. When that happened, my Clan was split between loyalties, you see. My Father, former Patriarch of our Clan, was as close as Kin with Jarl Ulfric, and for that matter, so was I, often referring to him as my Uncle. A fact that, despite how others in my Clan felt about Ulfric after the infamous duel, landed the majority of my Clan on the headman's chopping block. Only I was spared, thanks to Jarl Elisif\u2019s fondness for me and my Mother\u2019s connections to the Septim Dynasty back in Cyrodil. Orchestrating me to be sent to Winterhold, where I have been with the College ever since.\n\n**Civil War Stance**: Oskern\u2019s Response: That... It is a question more than a little complex. On one hand, my Father was a true Son of Skyrim, Talos Worshipper, and Shield-Brother of Uncle Ulfric. On the other hand, High King Torygg  was my childhood friend, and I served Solitude\u2019s bureaucracy proudly, as well as protected Queen Elisif as her pseudo Battle-Mage, for upwards of two years. She, too, is very important to me. So, siding with Ulfric would feel like a betrayal to her and to Torygg, but to take up arms in retribution for them... That would mean betraying my Mother, my Father, my Clan, and Legacy as the next Dragon of Haafingar. All that being said, I serve the College, and the magical pursuits I always wanted as a child, but it feels cowardly.\n\n**Motivation**: Oskern\u2019s Response: \u201cOnce upon a time, it was the Legacy of each Dragon of Haafingar, a title bestowed upon my family's Patriarch since the early 3rd Era, with my Ancestor Hakon Cindershroud mastering the Thu\u2019um, and being renowned for protecting Solitude with the Staff of Cinder\u2019s, and the Shout; Yol Tor Shuul! That\u2019s: Fire Breath, in the common tongue. Nowadays, that\u2019s the only Shout required by the Patriarch of Clan Cindershroud to don the title, a Shout I am pleased to say, even as an Imperial, that I have mastered in spades. These days, what drives me is my studies, my dream of becoming a legendary Arch Mage, and perhaps restoring my family\u2019s Nobility when this damnable war is over, and a new High King or Queen is chosen. Talos let that be soon.\n\n**Connections**: Oskern\u2019s Response: \u201cAnother, complicated question... Jarl Ulfric helped me hone my Thu\u2019um, rather, he helped me Master Fire Breath\u2019s shout. He is the reason I can wear the Title: Dragon of Haafingar. He was also the closest thing to Kin to my Nord Father, and always treated my Mother, Audania, with the utmost respect, despite the fact that she was an Imperial and the 4th or 5th Cousin of the Emperor of Cyrodil.  For this, he will always be my Uncle. Then there\u2019s Jarl Elisif... I never spoke this aloud, but I was always envious of Torygg, for I truly believe that I had loved Elisif, and she... Well, she never said it outright, but I knew she felt fondly for me on a deep level. Outside of those two, I have friends in my colleagues, Onmund, J\u2019zargo, and my teacher, Tolfdir. Whiterun? Hm, I once met the Harbinger of Jorvaskr with my father when I was but a boy, Kodlak, I think his name is. Beside him, I have spoken to Jarl Balgruuf the Greater, he is a man worthy of his title to say the least.\u201d",
