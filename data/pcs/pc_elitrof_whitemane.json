A fact that I am pleased to say, was indeed, the point of this venture. Fore though it had always been my desire to be counted amongst Ysgrammor\u2019s chosen few, and to one day be exonerated as a warrior worthy of the stories my shield sibling\u2019s and I had grown up hearin\u2019 bout from ole Vignar. To be a true Son of Skyrim, and a Nord who knew exactly all of what bein\u2019 one meant.\n\nIn order to accomplish any of this, I had realized during my tenor as a whelp, that I needed to take a page from my adoptive father. The greatest amongst our ilk, the Harbinger, Kodlak Whitemane. Fore if I were to ever aspire to be like he, Ysgrammor, and the other warriors of yesteryear, I needed to experience all of what lie outside of the den I was taken into, and do as my Elder Skjor would say: Perish amongst the flock, or be the one huntin\u2019 it.\n\nSo it was, like Kodlak before me, that I set out to endeavor to fully experience the land given to Men. Where I had traveled to where King Olaf had marched his armies upon Solitude, then to the sprawling snowfields where Ysgrammor had beset the Elves of yesteryore at Saarthal, before venturing southward to attempt the 10,000 step climb toward High Hrothgar. Through it all, I had garnered the battle acumen to match most of the Inner Circle, and had proudly absorbed more of our history than any book had ever learned me. By standin\u2019 upon the soil where the events actually happened.\n\nSo there I was, after two years of plying my trade with axe in hand and story in heart, I began to ascend the steps outside Ivarstead, and climb to the top of the mountain. Where I inevitably reached the Throat of the World, and met upon its peak a teacher whom spoke in two tongues. Who then elected to teach me to do the same. The language he taught? The Thu\u2019um.\u201d"

Kodlak first found Elitrof as the lone shipwreck survivor off Eastmarch and has long suspected Skaal roots on Solstheim."
