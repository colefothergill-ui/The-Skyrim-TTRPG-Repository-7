  "session_summary": "Elitrof ran Dustman's Cairn solo on Harbinger-sanctioned trial. He fought through Silver Hand hunters, disarmed Nordic traps, slew a Draugr Overlord, and recovered the Wuuthrad fragment. He learned YOL (Fire Breath) from the Word Wall inside the cairn and used Fire Breath unmastered in a critical duel. Elemental Fury Mastery advanced to 4/8 via dramatic three-word use. A Silver Hand survivor escaped. Post-cairn milestones spent to upgrade the Ulran-Vjarn pelt into an Artifact Extra.",
