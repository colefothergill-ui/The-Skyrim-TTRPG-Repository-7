## Skyrim-Specific Rules

### Magic System
Magic in Skyrim uses the Lore skill for casting and understanding spells.

**Spell Schools**:
- Destruction: Damage spells (fire, frost, shock)
- Restoration: Healing and protection
- Alteration: Manipulate reality (armor spells, telekinesis)
- Illusion: Affect minds (fear, calm, invisibility)
- Conjuration: Summon creatures and weapons

**Casting**: Roll Lore vs. target difficulty. Spending Fate Points can boost spell power.

### Dragon Shouts (Thu'um)
The Thu'um (Dragon Shouts) is an ancient Nordic tradition that can be learned through dedication, training, and discovery. This is NOT a Dragonborn-exclusive power in post-Alduin campaigns.

**Access**: 
- Nords can take "Voice of the Nord" Extra at character creation (1 Refresh)
- Bretons and Imperials can learn through "Way of the Voice" Extra (1 Refresh, learned during gameplay)

**Core Mechanics**:
- Shouts require Fate Point initially
- Each shout has a Mastery Clock (8 segments for Nords, 10 for others)
- Once mastered, shouts become "once per scene" without Fate Point cost
- Learning methods: Word Walls, Greybeard training, teachers, meditation

**Available Shouts**: Unrelenting Force, Whirlwind Sprint, Elemental Fury, Frost Breath, Fire Breath, Become Ethereal, and more.

**Complete mechanics**: See `data/rules/thuum_system.json` for full details on all shouts, learning methods, and progression systems.

### Combat
- Initiative: Highest Notice goes first
- Zones: Areas defined by the GM for tactical positioning
- Weapons: Can be aspects that add flavor to attacks

### Character Advancement
- **Minor Milestones**: After each session
  - Switch aspect values
  - Rename one aspect
  - Purchase a new stunt or +1 skill (if refresh/skill cap allows)
  
- **Significant Milestones**: After completing story arc
  - Gain one skill point (This campaign uses Skill Column advancement: you may raise any one skill by +1 without reshaping other skills; the only limit is the current skill cap.)
  - Gain new stunt or increase refresh
  - Rename aspects to reflect growth
  
- **Major Milestones**: After major story completion
  - Gain one skill point
  - Breakthrough: Exceed skill cap
  - Rename High Concept if appropriate

### Equipment
- Equipment provides aspects that can be invoked
- Quality matters: "Orcish Warhammer" vs "Iron Dagger"
- Enchanted items provide persistent benefits

## Running the Game

### Session Structure
1. **Recap**: Review previous session
2. **Scene Setup**: Describe the situation
3. **Action**: Players respond and roll dice
4. **Resolution**: Determine outcomes
5. **Fate Point Refresh**: Award compels and self-compels

### Creating Challenges
- Use skill rolls with opposition
- Set difficulty based on situation:
  - Poor (+1): Easy task
  - Fair (+2): Moderate challenge
  - Good (+3): Difficult task
  - Great (+4): Very difficult
  - Superb (+5): Extremely difficult

### Compels
- Offer Fate Points to make life harder
- "Your 'Impulsive' aspect means you rush into danger..."
- Players can refuse by spending a Fate Point

### GM Best Practices
- Keep the story moving forward
- Say "Yes, and..." or "No, but..." instead of flat no
- Let players be awesome
- Use aspects to drive the narrative
- Keep combat dynamic with zones and aspects
