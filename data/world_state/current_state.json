Jarls are being forced to choose sides, and the common people are caught in the middle. The Battle of Whiterun will be a pivotal moment.\n[2026-02-15] Continuity correction: prior references to Galmar Stone-Fist being slain and to a completed Goldenglow Estate job belonged to a retired PC timeline and are NOT canon for Oskern.\n[2026-02-15] Whiterun timing correction: the Battle of Whiterun has NOT begun; Balgruuf remains officially neutral.\n[2026-02-19] End-session update: Eye of Magnus chamber reached; Ancano publicly checked; expedition preparing to withdraw."
