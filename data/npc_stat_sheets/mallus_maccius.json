  "notes": "Mallus Maccius is an Imperial working at Honningbrew Meadery, but he's secretly Maven Black-Briar's agent. His job is to systematically sabotage the meadery by breeding skeevers in the basement, poisoning mead batches, and ensuring quality problems persist. He presents himself as a loyal, hardworking employee to Sabjorn while undermining the business from within. Maven's goal is to drive Honningbrew into bankruptcy so she can acquire it cheaply. Mallus is methodical, careful, and has been successfully deceiving Sabjorn for months. He's nervous about discovery but confident in his cover. If caught, he'll try to talk his way out or flee to Riften where Maven can protect him.",

He's an excellent liar with a talent for deflecting suspicion. When exposed or threatened, his facade drops and he becomes calculating and desperate. He'll offer bribes, threaten with Maven's name, or beg based on what he thinks will work.",
