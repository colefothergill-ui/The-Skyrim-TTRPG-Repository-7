  "notes": "Ancano is the Thalmor's agent within the College, ostensibly an 'advisor' but actually a spy and saboteur. He's charming when it suits him but reveals contempt for non-Altmer. His obsession with the Eye of Magnus drives the College questline's climax. In the final battle, he's empowered by the Eye, making him extremely dangerous.",
  "combat_tactics": "Ancano fights at range with Destruction magic (lightning preferred) and summons Daedric allies. When empowered by the Eye, he gains magical shields and area attacks. The Staff of Magnus is his weakness—it disrupts his connection to the Eye. Focus on high-damage spells and summons while maintaining wards.",

  "social_interaction": "Ancano is outwardly polite but condescending, especially to non-Altmer. He speaks with barely concealed superiority and dismisses concerns as provincial ignorance. He's patient but shows cracks when questioned about his authority or the Thalmor's intentions. In the endgame, his facade drops completely, revealing megalomaniacal ambition.",

    "eye_interest": "This 'Eye of Magnus' as you call it... fascinating. Such power should be properly understood. Managed. The Dominion has considerable expertise in such matters.",
    "revealed": "Did you truly think you could stop me? The Eye's power is beyond your comprehension. The Thalmor will reshape this world, and you will be nothing but forgotten footnotes!",

  },
  "gm_notes": "Ancano is the College questline's primary antagonist. Build him up slowly—polite menace, then showing his hand, finally megalomania. The Eye of Magnus fight should feel apocalyptic. Consider having magical instability effects during the battle—reality glitches, time distortions, summoned beings appearing randomly. If defeated, his death triggers Thalmor diplomatic response that can ripple through the campaign."
