  "notes": "Savos Aren is the Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold, a position he holds with great burden. Decades ago, he and a group of students ventured into Saarthal and encountered something terrible. He was the only survivor, and the experience haunts him. He's a powerful mage but politically weakened, forced to accept the Thalmor advisor Ancano as the price of the College's continued operation. He's increasingly isolated and stressed by his responsibilities.",

  "social_interaction": "Savos appears calm and authoritative but carries deep weariness. He's diplomatic and thoughtful, choosing words carefully.
