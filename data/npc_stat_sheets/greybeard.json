They are sworn to pacifism and use the Voice only for worship and meditation, except in the most dire circumstances. They are scholars of dragon lore and the ancient Nord traditions. Most communicate only through sign language, having taken vows of silence. Only Arngeir speaks regularly. They possess incredible power but restrain it through discipline and philosophy.",
