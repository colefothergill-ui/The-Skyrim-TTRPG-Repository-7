He's been secretly selling honey to competitors, cutting Maven Black-Briar out of her rightful profits. This has made him a target for the Thieves Guild in their 'Loud and Clear' operation. Aringoth is prideful, paranoid, and underestimates the guild's capabilities. He's hired mercenaries to protect the estate but doesn't realize how outmatched he is.",
