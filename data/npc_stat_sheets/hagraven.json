  "notes": "Hagravens are witches who have transformed themselves into monstrous bird-like creatures through dark magic. They serve as matriarchs of Forsworn tribes and conduct terrible rituals. They collect body parts for their magic and make dark pacts with those desperate enough to seek them out. Extremely dangerous both magically and in melee combat.",
  "combat_tactics": "Hagravens prefer to let Forsworn warriors engage enemies while they cast destructive magic and curses from the rear. They use hexes to weaken strong enemies and empower their allies. If cornered, they fight viciously with talons and beak. They may offer bargains to strong enemies they cannot defeat, preferring to corrupt rather than be destroyed.",
