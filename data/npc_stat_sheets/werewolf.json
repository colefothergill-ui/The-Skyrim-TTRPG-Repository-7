  "notes": "Werewolves are fearsome lycanthropes infected with the beast blood curse. They possess superhuman strength, speed, and regenerative abilities. In beast form, they are driven by primal hunting instincts and savage fury. Their regeneration makes them extremely difficult to kill unless combatants use silver weapons or fire, which prevents healing. Werewolves hunt primarily at night but can be encountered during the day in remote wilderness areas.",
  "combat_tactics": "Werewolves fight with savage ferocity, using their claws and enhanced physique to overwhelm prey. They prefer to leap into melee range and attack relentlessly. When wounded, they become more dangerous due to Savage Fury. They'll retreat only if severely wounded by silver or fire. They hunt alone or in small packs (2-3).",
