  "notes": "Ria is one of the younger Companions in the mead hall: courageous, eager, and desperate to prove she belongs. She's the first to volunteer and the last to admit fear. Her arc is learning that heroism isn't only charging first; it's choosing the right fight at the right time.",
  "combat_tactics": "Ria charges into melee and looks for an ally to guard. She fights best in formation \u2014 her stunts reward following orders and protecting shield-siblings. She is reckless when alone but nearly doubles her effectiveness protecting a named ally. GMs should use her eagerness against her: she can be baited into unfavorable positions.",

  "gm_notes": "Ria is the hall's heart in miniature: all the courage, none of the strategy yet. Use her to show what the Companions ideal looks like when it's untempered. Her bond quest is about letting her grow rather than rescuing her. She thrives when the PC treats her as an equal; she withers if handled as a mascot. In combat, place her where she can shine with her Shield-Sister stunt \u2014 she'll die happily defending a doorway."
