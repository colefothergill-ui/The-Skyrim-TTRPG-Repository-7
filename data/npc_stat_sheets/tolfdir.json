  "notes": "Tolfdir is one of the most senior members of the College of Winterhold, having studied magic for over a century. Despite his age and vast knowledge, he remains humble and patient, preferring hands-on teaching to lecturing.

He's wary of the Thalmor presence at the College, particularly Ancano.",
