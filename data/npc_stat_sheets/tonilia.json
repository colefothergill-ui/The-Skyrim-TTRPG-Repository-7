  "notes": "Tonilia is the Thieves Guild's fence and quartermaster, operating from the Ragged Flagon Cistern in Riften. She's a practical, no-nonsense Nord who knows the value of everything and trusts almost no one. She handles the guild's stolen goods, converting hot merchandise into cold coin, and also maintains the guild's armor and equipment supply. While she's not the warmest person in the guild, she's reliable and efficient, making her invaluable to operations. She has extensive contacts in Riften's black market and knows how to move goods without attracting attention.",
  "combat_tactics": "Tonilia avoids combat when possible, preferring to stay in the safety of the Cistern. If forced to fight, she relies on quick strikes and then retreating to more defensible positions. She's competent but not a warrior.",

  "social_interaction": "Tonilia is direct and businesslike. She doesn't waste time on pleasantries and gets straight to the point. She's skeptical of newcomers and watches them carefully, but will warm up slightly to those who prove reliable. Her speaking style is clipped and efficient, though she occasionally shows dry humor. She respects competence and dislikes sloppiness.",
