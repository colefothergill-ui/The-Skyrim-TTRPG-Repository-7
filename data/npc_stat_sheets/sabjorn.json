  "notes": "Sabjorn is the owner of Honningbrew Meadery, a struggling business that's been systematically sabotaged by Maven Black-Briar's agent Mallus Maccius. He's an honest, hardworking Nord trying to maintain his family's brewing legacy, but he's desperate and increasingly willing to bend the rules to save the meadery. He doesn't know that Mallus is the source of his problems - he thinks skeever infestations and quality issues are just bad luck. Maven's goal is to drive him to ruin so she can buy the meadery cheap and eliminate competition for Black-Briar Mead. Sabjorn is proud and stubborn, which makes him vulnerable to manipulation.",

He speaks with Nordic directness and takes pride in his family's brewing traditions. He'll eagerly accept help but is slow to trust when it comes to business rivals. His desperation makes him vulnerable to exploitation.",
