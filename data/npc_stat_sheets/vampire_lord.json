  "notes": "Vampire Lords are ancient and powerful vampires who have perfected their dark gifts over centuries. They command lesser vampires, possess tremendous magical power, and can transform into monstrous forms. Highly intelligent and cunning, they are master manipulators as well as deadly combatants. Sunlight weakens them severely, and fire can prevent their regeneration.",
  "combat_tactics": "Vampire Lords are strategic fighters who use thralls and lesser vampires as shields. They employ powerful magic, particularly life-drain spells. If threatened, they transform into Vampire Lord form for devastating melee attacks. They avoid sunlight at all costs and retreat if facing certain destruction to regenerate later.",
