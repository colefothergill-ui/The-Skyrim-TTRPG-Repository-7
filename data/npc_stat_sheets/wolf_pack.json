  "notes": "Wolf packs are common predators throughout Skyrim's forests and tundra. This stat block represents a coordinated pack acting as a single adversary using Fate Core conventions for nameless group enemies. Each stress box represents one wolf taken out. Packs use coordinated tactics and howling to intimidate prey. They fear fire and will flee if their pack is significantly reduced.",
  "combat_tactics": "Wolf packs surround targets and attack from multiple angles, using Pack Tactics to gain advantages. They target the weakest-looking member of a group. The pack uses Howling Dread early in combat to impose fear. If more than half the pack is defeated, survivors flee. Fire-based attacks cause the pack to scatter immediately.",
