  "notes": "Jarl Korir is the embittered ruler of Winterhold Hold, watching over the ruins of what was once a prosperous city. The Great Collapse destroyed most of Winterhold, and Korir—like many locals—blames the College of Winterhold for the catastrophe. He's suspicious, guarded, and deeply resentful. Despite this, he's a capable leader doing his best to protect his people with minimal resources. He supports the Stormcloaks but receives little aid due to Winterhold's strategic insignificance.",
  "combat_tactics": "Korir is a competent warrior but not exceptional. He fights with one-handed weapon and shield in traditional Nord style—defensive but aggressive when protecting his people. He'll prioritize his citizens' safety over personal glory. In civil war scenarios, he'll defend Winterhold fiercely but knows when to yield to superior force.",

  "social_interaction": "Korir is guarded and suspicious, especially with outsiders and anyone associated with the College. He speaks of Winterhold's past glory with bitter nostalgia. He's more forthcoming with fellow Nords and Stormcloak sympathizers, but even then maintains distance. Those who prove themselves helpful to Winterhold (not the College) can earn grudging respect. He's haunted by responsibility for dwindling population.",

  "gm_notes": "Korir is defined by loss and bitterness. He's not a villain but an antagonist to College-friendly parties. His suspicions aren't entirely unfounded—College's neutrality during civil war seems callous from his perspective, and magical catastrophe is plausible explanation for Collapse. Use him to create tension between party and College if they become too cozy with mages. He can be won over through actions benefiting Winterhold specifically, creating interesting political dynamics. His potential replacement by Kraldar provides civil war stakes. Remember: he's tragic figure, not tyrant—he's doing his best with impossible situation."
