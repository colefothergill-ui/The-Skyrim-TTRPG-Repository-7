### Stunts
1) Rake and Rend: When Elitrof Defends with Fight while dual-wielding and succeeds with style, he may forgo the boost to instead inflict 2 physical stress on the attacker. If he also spends 1 Fate Point, he may create the scene aspect 'Rending Blow' with 2 free invokes.
2) Flyting Words: Elitrof gains +2 to Provoke when insulting, jeering, or intimidating with sharp Nordic verse. On success with style, he may create the scene aspect 'Brutal Eloquence' with 1 free invoke.
3) Lore Authority: Elitrof gains +2 to Lore when recalling Skyrim or Solstheim history/culture. When persuasion is grounded in knowledge, precedent, or storytelling, he may use Lore to Overcome as if it were Rapport (GM discretion).

## Backstory (Elitrof's Personal Log)
- Left Jorrvaskr ~5 years ago to walk Skyrim's mythic sites and become worthy of the songs.
- Learned the Thu'um at the Throat of the World.
- Journeyed to Solstheim, earned the Skaal's trust, and slew the legendary werebear haunting the clan.
- Wears the werebear hide as a cloak, telling outsiders it's merely an oversized bear pelt.

- **Farkas**: Childhood best friend and shield-sibling; loyal and straightforward.
- **Vilkas**: Childhood best friend and shield-sibling; disciplined, demanding, pushes Elitrof to earn his legend.
- **Vignar Greymane**: Grandfather-figure storyteller; stoked Elitrof's hunger for glory and reverence.
