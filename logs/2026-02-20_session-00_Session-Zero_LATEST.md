## Backstory (Elitrof's Personal Log)
- Left Jorrvaskr ~5 years ago to walk Skyrim's mythic sites and become worthy of the songs.
- Learned the Thu'um at the Throat of the World.
- Journeyed to Solstheim, earned the Skaal's trust, and slew the legendary werebear haunting the clan.
- Wears the werebear hide as a cloak, telling outsiders it's merely an oversized bear pelt.
