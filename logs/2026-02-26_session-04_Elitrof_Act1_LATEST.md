## Key Events — Scene by Scene

### 1. Departure from Jorrvaskr
Elitrof departed Jorrvaskr at dawn with Kodlak, Farkas, and Vilkas, carrying the three Glenmoril Witch Heads. The Inner Circle kept the departure quiet — Aela and Skjor were not invited. Kodlak traveled in silence, his expression unreadable. The weight of what waited at the Tomb was spoken only in the steady pace of four warriors on the road north.

### 2. Nightgate Pass — Silver Hand Ambush
On the road through Nightgate Pass, a Silver Hand ambush squad hit the column.
- Elitrof opened with **Fire Breath (Yol)** — unmastered, FP spent — driving the Silver Hand lead unit back and buying space for the twins to flank.
- The ambush was broken. No Companions fell.
- **Fire Breath Mastery advanced: 2/8 → 4/8** (critical use + dramatic witness; Kodlak and the twins all present).
- Nightgate Pass notes secured as field intelligence → Map Case created.
- Advantage gained: **Know the Passes**.

### 3. Approach to Ysgramor's Tomb
The party reached Ysgramor's Tomb at dusk. The tomb's mouth yawned over the frozen shore. Kodlak said little. Elitrof spoke the Oath-Words at the threshold, and the doors opened.

### 4. The Cure Rite — Harbinger Flame
In the inner sanctum, before the Harbinger's Flame, Elitrof performed the cure rite using the Glenmoril Witch Heads.
- **Kodlak cured first.** The wolf-spirit manifested and was destroyed by Kodlak's own blade — his final act against the beast he had carried for decades.
- **Vilkas cured second.** Elitrof held the rite-space steady; Vilkas landed the finishing strike on his own wolf-spirit. Elitrof defended his will against the wolf's projection.
- **Farkas cured last.** His wolf-spirit manifested — larger and wilder than the others — and was destroyed.
- **All three Glenmoril Witch Heads expended.** Cure chain complete.
- Companions cured: Kodlak, Vilkas, Farkas.
- Companions remaining with beast blood: Aela, Skjor.

### 5. Kodlak's Private Signal — Harbingership
After the rite, Kodlak drew Elitrof aside in the tomb's reliquary. In a quiet exchange, he signaled — without naming it formally — that he saw Elitrof as the future Harbinger.
- Official naming deferred.
- Harbingership succession hint recorded.

### 6. Wuuthrad Reforged
In the Reliquary, Elitrof found the Reforging Stone. The Wuuthrad Fragment, recovered from Dustman's Cairn, was brought to the stone and reforged into **Wuuthrad (Reforged Legendary Waraxe)**.
- Weapon:4; +3 Fight while wielding; +3 vs Mer; Ancient Fury 1/session
- The Wuuthrad Fragment is expended. Wuuthrad (Reforged) now carried by Elitrof.

### 7. Session Close — Reliquary
- **Shield of Ysgramor** remains with Elitrof (recovered previous session).
- Party prepares to leave the Tomb.
- **Active Quest updated:** companions_purity_path_ignites.

All three Glenmoril Witch Heads were expended; Kodlak, Vilkas, and Farkas are cured. Wuuthrad was reforged. Kodlak privately signaled Elitrof as a future Harbinger candidate. Fire Breath mastery advanced to 4/8.

### Next Session Hook

- Circle werewolves remaining: Aela, Skjor.
- Harbingership succession hint active (unofficial; Kodlak's private signal only).
