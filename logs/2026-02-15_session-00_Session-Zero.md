**Date**: 2026-02-15  
**In-Game Date**: 17th of Last Seed, 4E 201  
**GM**: ChatGPT (Charlotte) &amp; Cole  
**Players Present**: Cole  
**Active PC**: Oskern Cindershroud  
**Current Act**: Act 1  
**Starting Location**: Winterhold → College of Winterhold

---

## Session Summary

Session 0 pivots the campaign's opening to the **College of Winterhold**, with Oskern already recognized as an **Adept** and pulled immediately into a "you're responsible for the students" kind of situation.

Mirabelle Ervine assigns Oskern as the **expedition lead** for Tolfdir's Saarthal dig, with three students attached to the team:
- **Onmund** (frontline ward support)
- **Brelyna Maryon** (midline utility / stabilization)
- **J'zargo** (rearline artillery / "please don't explode us")  

Oskern signs out a **College-Issued Field Kit**, accepts a **Standing Stone Compel** (Atronach Stone: magicka-starved surge), and clears the immediate exhaustion by downing a **Magicka potion** before departure.

## Scenes Played

### Scene: College Courtyard — Saarthal Briefing
**Scene ID**: `A1_S00_COLLEGE_SAARTHAL_BRIEFING`  
**Objective**: Lead the Saarthal expedition team; reach the dig site and keep the students alive.

**Key beats**
- Mirabelle lays down the rule: the College can tolerate chaos, but not *dead students*. Oskern is accountable.
- Oskern takes the issued satchel and immediately prepares the squad like a battlefield unit (treating the expedition like a disciplined field unit).
- **Compel (Accepted)**: Atronach Stone — sudden magicka-starved surge hits as preparations begin.
  - **Resolution**: Oskern drinks a Magicka potion to clear the immediate exhaustion.
- Oskern establishes expedition formation doctrine and assigns combat roles.

## Fate + Mechanics Snapshot

### Compel Log
- **Atronach Stone: Magicka-Starved Surge** — *Accepted*

## Character Backstory

**Backstory Summary**: **Civil War Entry**: Oskern's Response: "My Father, Lord Elitrigg Cindershroud, and my Mother, Lady Audania of Cyrodil, entered me into a raffle called life. Just a jest, but only just. As the heir to Clan Cindershroud and son of the Legendary War Hero, the Dragon of Hjaalmarch, when war broke out, it was inevitable that I would end up in it. The short of it is that I was once Thane of Solitude by the age of 18, accepted and assessed as an Adept of the College of Winterhold at 23, and watched my best friend High King Torygg die at 25. When that happened, my Clan was split between loyalties, you see. My Father, former Patriarch of our Clan, was as close as Kin with Jarl Ulfric, and for that matter, so was I, often referring to him as my Uncle. A fact that, despite how others in my Clan felt about Ulfric after the infamous duel, landed the majority of my Clan on the headman's chopping block. Only I was spared, thanks to Jarl Elisif's fondness for me and my Mother's connections to the Septim Dynasty back in Cyrodil. Orchestrating me to be sent to Winterhold, where I have been with the College ever since.

**Civil War Stance**: Oskern's Response: That... It is a question more than a little complex. On one hand, my Father was a true Son of Skyrim, Talos Worshipper, and Shield-Brother of Uncle Ulfric. On the other hand, High King Torygg  was my childhood friend, and I served Solitude's bureaucracy proudly, as well as protected Queen Elisif as her pseudo Battle-Mage, for upwards of two years. She, too, is very important to me. So, siding with Ulfric would feel like a betrayal to her and to Torygg, but to take up arms in retribution for them... That would mean betraying my Mother, my Father, my Clan, and Legacy as the next Dragon of Haafingar. All that being said, I serve the College, and the magical pursuits I always wanted as a child, but it feels cowardly.

**Motivation**: Oskern's Response: "Once upon a time, it was the Legacy of each Dragon of Haafingar, a title bestowed upon my family's Patriarch since the early 3rd Era, with my Ancestor Hakon Cindershroud mastering the Thu'um, and being renowned for protecting Solitude with the Staff of Cinder's, and the Shout; Yol Tor Shuul! That's: Fire Breath, in the common tongue. Nowadays, that's the only Shout required by the Patriarch of Clan Cindershroud to don the title, a Shout I am pleased to say, even as an Imperial, that I have mastered in spades. These days, what drives me is my studies, my dream of becoming a legendary Arch Mage, and perhaps restoring my family's Nobility when this damnable war is over, and a new High King or Queen is chosen. Talos let that be soon.

**Connections**: Oskern's Response: "Another, complicated question... Jarl Ulfric helped me hone my Thu'um, rather, he helped me Master Fire Breath's shout. He is the reason I can wear the Title: Dragon of Haafingar. He was also the closest thing to Kin to my Nord Father, and always treated my Mother, Audania, with the utmost respect, despite the fact that she was an Imperial and the 4th or 5th Cousin of the Emperor of Cyrodil.  For this, he will always be my Uncle. Then there's Jarl Elisif... I never spoke this aloud, but I truly believe that I had loved Elisif, and she... Well, she never said it outright, but I knew she felt fondly for me on a deep level. Outside of those two, I have friends in my colleagues, Onmund, J'zargo, and my teacher, Tolfdir. Whiterun? Hm, I once met the Harbinger of Jorvaskr with my father when I was but a boy, Kodlak, I think his name is. Beside him, I have spoken to Jarl Balgruuf the Greater, he is a man worthy of his title to say the least."

## Continuity Notes (Canon Fixes)

- **Whiterun**: The Battle of Whiterun has **not** begun; Balgruuf remains **officially neutral**.
- **Galmar Stone-Fist**: Alive and active; prior "Galmar killed" references were from a retired PC timeline.
- **Thieves Guild bleedthrough**: Prior Goldenglow progress does **not** apply to Oskern.

- **Student NPC stat sheets + bios** are present/verified.
- **Civil War timeline** corrected: Whiterun neutral; battle approaching.
- **Campaign state** updated to reflect:
  - expedition lead = Oskern
  - expedition team = Onmund / Brelyna / J'zargo
  - compel resolution recorded
  - scene aspects + logistics clock seeded

---

## Next Session Preview

The team departs the College for Saarthal. The first real question isn't "what's down there?" — it's **how quickly the situation forces Oskern to choose between caution and speed** while three students (each with their own ego + fear cocktail) try not to die on his watch.

## Courtyard Leadership & Wolves on the Road

### Courtyard Speech - Role Assignments
Following the initial setup, Oskern stood before the assembled students in the College courtyard. The expedition south required organization, and as the son of a war hero and a lord of noble lineage, command came naturally—even if it drew unwanted attention.

**Role Assignments**:
- **Scouts**: Faster students tasked with ranging ahead
- **Rear Guard**: Watchful students protecting the column's back
- **Core Formation**: Main group with supply packs
- **Oskern**: Front leadership position

The speech was measured but confident. Students who had been uncertain now had purpose. The formation took shape with surprising discipline.

### Mechanics Block

**Scene Aspect Created Earlier**: "Signed for Their Safety"
- **Created by**: Oskern (prior to courtyard scene)
- **Free Invokes**: 1
- **Notes**: PC declared responsibility for student safety during expedition planning; promise carries weight.

**Compel Accepted**: "Prove You're Worthy of the Dragon of Haafingar"
- **Fate Point Gained**: +1 FP (total: 2 FP)
- **Scene Aspect Created**: "All Eyes on Cindershroud" (GM-controlled, 1 free invoke)
- **Effect**: Oskern's command presence and noble bearing drew attention from everyone present. His reputation now precedes him on this journey.

**Rapport Roll - Create Advantage**: "Calm Under Command"
- **Roll**: +1 on 4dF + Rapport +3 + 2 (invoke "Signed for Their Safety") = +6 vs. Difficulty 2
- **Result**: Success with Style
- **Free Invoke Consumed**: Invoked "Signed for Their Safety" to ensure success
- **Scene Aspect Created**: "Calm Under Command" (2 free invokes)
- **Effect**: Students are organized, roles are clear, formation discipline is reinforced

**Scene Aspect Updated**:
- "Signed for Their Safety" → free invokes reduced to 0 (consumed in Rapport roll)

### Travel Beat: Wolves on the Road

As the expedition descended from Winterhold's frozen heights toward the winding road south, the landscape opened into snow-swept tundra. The cold bit hard, but the formation held.

Then the scouts spotted movement: **ice wolves**, pale as death, shadowing the expedition from rocky outcrops. They didn't attack—not yet—but their presence was unmistakable. Yellow eyes gleamed in the failing light.

The students tensed. Oskern's hand moved instinctively to the Staff of Cinders. The wolves kept pace, watching, waiting.

**Threat Level**: Moderate (wolves are tracking, not yet hostile)
**Next Beat**: Decide whether to press forward, confront the pack, or adjust route

**Session End Time**: Campaign start (pre-adventure)
**Real World Duration**: Session Zero setup

## Travel Encounter: Ice Wolf Pack Ambush

### Context
During travel between locations, the party was ambushed by a pack of ice wolves. The encounter tested Oskern's combat magic and tactical thinking.

### Mechanics
- **Lore Attack Roll**: 4dF (+1) + Lore +4 = 5 (base attack roll)
- **Fireball Stunt**: +2 bonus (once per scene, area attack)
- **Atronach Stone Surge**: +2 bonus (Atronach-empowered casting)
- **Aspect Invocation**: "Shield-Wall Doctrine" +2 (free invoke - tactical positioning and Imperial military training)
- **Total Attack**: 5 (roll) + 2 (Fireball) + 2 (Atronach) + 2 (Shield-Wall free invoke) = 11
- **Outcome**: Ice wolf pack was **Taken Out** in a single devastating strike

### Consequences & Aspects
- **Temporary Aspect Created**: "Magicka-Starved Aftershock" (1 GM free invoke)
  - Represents the backlash from the Atronach Stone after channeling significant Destruction magic
  - Persists until cleared by potion or magical absorption
  - GM may invoke this to complicate future magical actions

### Clock Updates
- **Ancano Suspicion Meter**: +1 (now at 1/8)
  - College students witnessed the memorable display of magical power
  - Ancano becomes aware of PC's exceptional capabilities

## Saarthal Interior: Loot Under Fire & Ward Hold

### Context
Having reached Saarthal's inner chambers, the expedition encountered a collapsing ward system. As draugr began stirring in adjacent passages, Oskern spotted sentinel ash containing what appeared to be a burial sigil—a potential key to bypassing the failing wards. Time was critical: the team needed to secure the artifact before the undead fully awakened.

### Mechanics: Loot Under Pressure

**Scene Aspect Created** (earlier during chamber entry): "Saarthal Resonance Attunement"
- **Initial free invokes**: 2
- **Created by**: Scene environment (ancient Nordic magic resonating with expedition's approach)
- **Effect**: The ruins' latent magical signature provided clarity and focus during high-stress salvage operations

**Notice Overcome Roll - Rapid Salvage**:
- **Skill**: Notice (Overcome action)
- **Difficulty**: Good (+3) — identifying and extracting the correct sigil from ash and debris under time pressure
- **Roll**: 4dF (+1) + Notice +2 + invoke +2 = +5 vs. Good (+3)
- **Aspect Invoked**: "Saarthal Resonance Attunement" (+2 bonus, consumed 1 free invoke)
- **Outcome**: Success (beat difficulty by +2)
- **Boost Created**: "Right Key, Right Now" (1 free invoke)
- **Item Acquired**: **Saarthal Burial Sigil** (quest key / ward-bypass artifact)

**Aspect Updated**:
- "Saarthal Resonance Attunement" → 1 free invoke remaining (started with 2, consumed 1 during loot action)

### Mechanics: Ward Seam Defense

While Oskern secured the sigil, Onmund and Tolfdir worked in tandem to stabilize a critical ward seam that was beginning to fail. Their combined effort held the breach long enough to delay the approaching draugr and buy the team precious seconds.

**Create Advantage (Teamwork) - Hold the Line**:
- **Primary Actor**: Onmund (ward maintenance)
- **Support**: Tolfdir (ward reinforcement and seam repair)
- **Roll**: 4dF (+0) + Onmund's Lore (Ward Theory) +3 + Teamwork +1 (Tolfdir support) = +4 vs. Good (+3)
- **Difficulty**: Good (+3) — stabilizing failing ancient Nordic wards under combat pressure
- **Outcome**: Success (beat difficulty by +1)
- **Scene Aspect Created**: "Ward Held at the Seam" (1 free invoke)
  - **Created by**: npc_stat_onmund + npc_stat_tolfdir
  - **Effect**: Onmund maintained ward integrity while Tolfdir reinforced the seam; delayed approaching draugr

### Clock Updates

**Saarthal Expedition Progress — Danger Escalation**: 6/6 (COMPLETE)
- The expedition has now penetrated deep enough into Saarthal to trigger full draugr awakening
- Undead response escalates to maximum intensity
- The team faces immediate combat threat as ancient guardians rise to defend the ruins

**Narrative Impact**:
- The sigil provides a path forward through ward-sealed passages
- But the cost is clear: the expedition has disturbed something ancient, and Saarthal's defenders are fully awakened
- The team must now fight or flee, with limited options for retreat

### Session Aspects Summary (Updated)
- **"College-Issued Field Kit"**: 2 free invokes remaining
- **"Shield-Wall Doctrine"**: 1 free invoke remaining
- **"Signed for Their Safety"**: 0 free invokes remaining (consumed in Rapport roll)

## Post-Threshold Regroup (2026-02-15 Patch)

- Oskern refused "Rear-Guard Pride" and regrouped through the threshold.
- Trust gains: Tolfdir +10 (relationship now 45); student loyalties increased (Onmund/Brelyna/J'zargo now 40/38/42 respectively).
- Staff Awakening ticked to 2/6 due to mythic protective use.
- New scene aspect created: **"Threshold Sealed"** (created by npc_stat_tolfdir; Tolfdir used the Saarthal Burial Sigil to seal the threshold against pursuit from the inner chambers; 0 free invokes).

## Eye Chamber: Atronach Hunger Siphon (2026-02-15)

### Narrative

Oskern faced the Eye of Magnus directly. The Atronach Stone's hunger surged as the Eye's power beckoned. Rather than resist, Oskern accepted the compel and channeled the draw through the Staff of Cinders, invoking his title as Dragon of Haafingar to maintain control of the siphon.

### Mechanics: Controlled Eye Siphon (Create Advantage)

- **Action**: Create Advantage (controlled siphon of Eye output through Staff of Cinders)
- **Skill**: Lore
- **Pre-Established Scene Aspect**: **"Containment Lattice Harmonized"** (2 free invokes, created by npc_stat_tolfdir)
  - Tolfdir performed a warding ritual before the siphon test to lace the Eye chamber with interlocking containment sigils. This layered lattice can absorb, dampen, or redirect uncontrolled magical surges from the Eye.
- **Compel Accepted**: Atronach Hunger (+1 FP)
- **Aspect Invoked**: "Dragon of Haafingar" (-1 FP, +2 bonus)
- **Roll**: 4dF (-1) + Lore +3 + invoke +2 ("Dragon of Haafingar") = +4 vs. Great (+3) — **Success (beat difficulty by +1)**
- **Outcome**: Success — Created aspect **"Measured Eye Siphon"** (1 free invoke)
  - **Created by**: pc_oskern_cindershroud
  - **Effect**: Controlled siphon channel from the Eye through Staff of Cinders; safe 'battery charge' and resonance key.
- **GM Trigger**: Eye answered the siphon with an uncontrolled surge → Aspect **"Overcharged Conduit"** placed (GM-controlled, free invoke spent immediately on Eye surge)
- **Tolfdir Response**: Spent 1 free invoke from "Containment Lattice Harmonized" (2 → 1) to stabilize the Eye surge.

### Clock Updates

- **Ancano Suspicion Meter**: 4 → 5 (+1 from Eye Chamber siphon via Atronach Hunger compel)
- **Staff of Cinders Awakening**: 2 → 3 (+1: Eye-channeling via Staff counted as mythic protective use)

### Fate Points

- Accepted Compel (Atronach Hunger): +1 FP
- Invoked Dragon of Haafingar: -1 FP
- **Current FP**: 3 (unchanged net)

### Trust Nudges

- Tolfdir relationship: 45 → 46 (+1)
- Onmund loyalty: 40 → 42 (+2)
- Brelyna Maryon loyalty: 38 → 39 (+1)
- J'zargo loyalty: 42 → 43 (+1)

## Eye Chamber: SWS Drain + Boon + Triggers (2026-02-15)

### Narrative

Oskern pressed further, spending the free invokes from "Calm Under Command" and "Saarthal Resonance Attunement" to achieve a Success with Style on a second Eye siphon. The Staff of Cinders blazed with absorbed power. The Eye's output was redirected into a supercharged reservoir keyed to the containment lattice — but the surge was loud enough to reach Ancano's ears.

### Mechanics: SWS Eye Siphon (Create Advantage)

- **Action**: Create Advantage (deep Eye siphon via Staff conduit)
- **Skill**: Lore
- **Aspects Invoked (free)**:
  - "Calm Under Command" (1 free invoke consumed → 0 remaining, +2 bonus)
  - "Saarthal Resonance Attunement" (1 free invoke consumed → 0 remaining, +2 bonus)
- **Roll**: 4dF (+2) + Lore +4 + free invokes +4 ("Calm Under Command" +2, "Saarthal Resonance Attunement" +2) = +10 vs. Good (+3) — **Success with Style (beat difficulty by +7)**
- **Outcome**: Success with Style — Created aspect **"Eye-Fed Reservoir"** (2 free invokes)
  - **Created by**: pc_oskern_cindershroud
  - **Effect**: Supercharged reservoir keyed to containment lattice; controlled Eye output via Staff of Cinders.
- **Boon Granted**: "Eye-Touched Mastery" — one-use +2 bonus on Lore or Will rolls related to the Eye of Magnus or ward magic.
- **GM Trigger**: Ancano alerted to Eye activity → Aspect **"Ancano's Attention"** placed (1 GM-controlled free invoke).

### Clock Updates

- **Ancano Suspicion Meter**: 5 → 6 (+1 from SWS Eye siphon; Eye activity detected by Ancano; trigger "Ancano's Attention")
- **Staff of Cinders Awakening**: 3 → 4 (+1: Legendary Eye-siphon via Staff conduit)
- **Eye of Magnus Instability**: Clock created at 1/6 (ticked once from initial Eye siphon)

### Session Aspects Summary (Updated)

## Eye Chamber: Oskern Checks Ancano Publicly

### Narrative

Ancano attempted to claim authority over the Eye of Magnus in front of assembled faculty and students. Oskern stepped forward, leveraging his title and a carefully prepared diplomatic brief to publicly refute the Thalmor Envoy's overreach. The confrontation was decisive — Ancano was forced into an observer posture, his authority grab shut down before it could take root.

### Mechanics: Rapport Overcome vs Ancano (Eye Chamber)

- **Action**: Overcome (Rapport)
- **Skill**: Rapport (+3)
- **Opposition**: Great (+4) — Ancano's Thalmor authority and prepared position
- **Modifiers**:
  - Situational boost "Rehearsed Treaty Brief" (+2)
  - Invoked aspect "Dragon of Haafingar" (+2, −1 FP)
- **Fate Points**: 3 → 2 (spent 1 FP on "Dragon of Haafingar" invoke)
- **Roll**: 4dF (+0) + Rapport +3 + boost +2 + invoke +2 = +7 vs Great +4 (beat difficulty by +3)
- **Result**: Success with Style (beat difficulty by +3)
- **Outcome**: Created scene aspect **"Thalmor Overreach Publicly Checked"** (2 free invokes)
  - **Created by**: pc_oskern_cindershroud
  - **Effect**: Ancano forced into observer posture; tension rises. Faculty and students witnessed the rebuke.

### Clock Updates

- **Ancano Powerplay**: Created at 1/4 (first open authority grab, publicly checked)

### Trust Nudges

- **Tolfdir**: +1 (witnessed Oskern hold the line against Thalmor pressure)
- **Onmund loyalty**: +1
- **Brelyna loyalty**: +1
- **J'zargo loyalty**: +1
