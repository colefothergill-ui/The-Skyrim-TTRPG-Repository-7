## Key Events Since Start of Session
1. **Homecoming at Jorrvaskr**: Elitrof returned to the Companions; flytinged a whelp publicly over "hide the Talos amulet" talk (took Trouble compel).
2. **Sparring**: Elitrof proved his edge in a friendly bout with Vilkas + Farkas, re-establishing status in the hall.
3. **Contracts taken**: Shrine of Talos protection, Chillfurrow wolves, Pelagia giant.
4. **Talos Shrine Sting**: Harassment revealed as an identification trap for Talos worshippers.
   - **Vignar intel recorded**: named Nazeem as the mouthpiece; suspected Battle-Born backing; confirmed a Thalmor Justiciar handler present.
   - **Justiciar Varyn** escalated first (spellcasting), was subdued and **captured alive**; sustained severe injury (missing sword hand) and moderate wound (raked chest); cauterized to prevent bleed-out.
   - **Nazeem** and a **borrowed-uniform enforcer** were captured.
   - Pilgrim witnesses observed the Justiciar strike first.

## NPCs Encountered
- **Kodlak Whitemane** (Harbinger; adoptive father)
- **Skjor** (mentor, hardline)
- **Farkas & Vilkas** (shield-siblings)
- **Vignar Greymane** (storyteller; intelligence source)
- **Justiciar Varyn** (captured)
- **Nazeem** (captured)
- **Borrowed-Uniform Enforcer** (captured)
- **Pilgrims at Talos Shrine** (witnesses)

## Party Split
- **Vilkas** escorting prisoners to **Dragonsreach** to report to **Jarl Balgruuf**.
- **Elitrof + Farkas** proceeding to **Chillfurrow Farm** (wolves), then **Pelagia Farm** (giant).

## Open Threads / Pending GM Beats
- Trouble compel offered on the road (travelers approving Talos persecution) — **unresolved**.
- Balgruuf reaction: legal framing + political fallout for the captured Justiciar.
- Thalmor retaliation clock active; narrative control attempts expected.

## Checkpoint: Chillfurrow Wolves (Den Cleared)
- Elitrof pursued a runner wolf to the den (Whiterun/Pale treeline gully).
- Brewed and refined a Berserker Draught (Skaal Crimson Cut), consumed dose #1, stored dose #2.
- Used Nord racial Battle Cry to force the pack to flee for one round and seize initiative.
- Cleared the den of pack wolves and took out the Alpha in close quarters.
- **Contract status:** Chillfurrow Wolves completed; civilians and livestock secured (Farkas held the farm line).
- **Elitrof status:** FP 3; Physical Stress boxes 1 and 3 marked; no consequences.
- **Farkas status:** minor bite (stress 1).
- **Clocks:** Companions Trust 6/10; Battle of Whiterun Countdown 1/8; Thalmor Retaliation: Whiterun 1/8.

---
## Scene Resolution: Pelagia Farm Giant (Solo Duel)
- Elitrof sent Farkas ahead as witness and took the Pelagia giant **alone**.
- **Accepted a Warrior-Poet saga-risk Compel** (+1 FP), then **spent 1 FP** to unleash **Elemental Fury (Su Grah Dun)** (unmastered).
- The giant was dismantled via leg-work: hamstring strikes → knees shredded → finishing dual-axe descent to the skull.
- **Reroll note:** Elitrof spent **1 FP** to reroll a near-hit dodge, reframing it as a clean miss (no added stress).
- **Contract status:** Pelagia giant **completed**; Pelagia farmhands secured; Farkas can corroborate the tale.

### Final Session State (End Session Protocol)
- **Elitrof status:** FP **2**; Physical stress **1 and 3 marked**; no consequences.
- **Active clocks:**
  - Battle of Whiterun Countdown: **1/8**
  - Thalmor Retaliation: Whiterun: **1/8**
  - Elemental Fury Mastery: **2/8** (Su, Grah)
  - Companions Trust: **7/10** (Champion)
- **Unresolved thread:** Vilkas is at **Dragonsreach** with captives (Justiciar Varyn, Nazeem, guard-imposter) awaiting **Balgruuf's ruling**.

### Milestone Awarded
- **Minor Milestone** (end of session): Elitrof may rename/swap one aspect, adjust an aspect, or purchase a stunt/+1 skill (subject to refresh/skill cap rules).

### Next Session Hook
