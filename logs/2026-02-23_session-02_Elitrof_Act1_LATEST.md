### Character Knowledge (GM Canon)
- Elitrof does **not** know the Inner Circle (including Kodlak) are werewolves. Kodlak kept it secret (protective) and forbade Skjor from revealing it until the Underforge rite.
- Farkas and Vilkas also have not told him yet; they were instructed not to by Kodlak.

## Dustman's Cairn Interior (Resolution)
- Elitrof fought through Silver Hand hunters inside the cairn, disarmed traps, and reached the relic chamber.
- Recovered the **Wuuthrad fragment** and slew a **Draugr Overlord** in single combat.

- **Elemental Fury Mastery now 4/8** after dramatic 3-word use.
- Loot: Rune-etched Nord torc (warmth), +330 septims, sapphire, garnet, Vigorous Healing potion.
- Status: FP 1; Mild consequence: Sliced Upper Arm; Stress persists pending end-session clear.
