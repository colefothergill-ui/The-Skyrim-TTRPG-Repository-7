# Session 00 LATEST — Under Saarthal (2026-02-15)

## One-Page Recap
Oskern led the College expedition from Winterhold to Saarthal, held the students together under pressure, and fought through wolves, wards, and awakened draugr. Deep within the ruins, the party reached a sealed chamber housing the **Eye of Magnus**. Oskern, driven by Atronach hunger but using the **Staff of Cinders** as a controlled conduit, successfully siphoned a measured charge without detonating the containment lattice, creating a stored **Eye-Fed Reservoir**. Ancano attempted to seize authority over the discovery and was publicly checked, forced into observer posture.

## Mechanical Highlights
- **Eye-Fed Reservoir**: 2 charges (PC extra)
- **Eye-Touched Mastery**: 1 charge (PC extra)
- **Ancano Suspicion**: 6/8
- **Ancano Powerplay**: 1/4 (first grab, publicly checked)

## Stop Point
- **Next Scene ID**: A1_S01_SAARTHAL_WITHDRAWAL
- **Location**: Saarthal — Eye Chamber (pre-withdrawal)
- **Objective**: Withdraw from Saarthal with the students and the College's notes. Report the Eye of Magnus discovery to Arch-Mage Savos Aren. Keep Ancano boxed into "observer" status.

## Artifact Event: Staff of Cinders Awakening 6/6

### Jyrik Gauldurson — Eye Chamber Finisher
In the Saarthal Eye Chamber, Jyrik Gauldurson — a Draugr Death Overlord empowered by the Eye of Magnus — rose as the final guardian. Oskern engaged with Fire Breath (Yol, two-word), channeling through the Staff of Cinders and invoking its aspect to intensify the blast. The Eye's ambient energy fed back through the conduit, triggering a near-catastrophic surge in the staff's rune matrix (mythic consequence narrowly averted via Will overcome). The combined pressure — named foe defeated with fire magic through the staff's aspect, mythic consequence survived through the staff's matrix — was enough to tip the Awakening clock from 4/6 to 6/6.

**Mechanics:**
- Action: Attack (Lore), Fire Breath two-word (Yol Toor) + Staff of Cinders Dragon Fire trait (reroll 4dF)
- Invoked: "Heirloom of the Dragon of Haafingar" (Staff aspect, -1 FP)
- Result: Jyrik Gauldurson Taken Out; Eye surge created temporary aspect "Overcharged Rune Matrix" (GM free invoke 1, spent immediately)
- Staff Awakening triggers met: *Defeat a named foe using fire magic while invoking the staff's aspect* (+1); *Survive a mythic consequence caused by your own power* (+1) → clock 4/6 → **6/6 RESOLVED**

On Jyrik Gauldurson's defeat, the Staff of Cinders completes its Awakening. Hairline runes flare along the ebony length, revealing a hidden Thu'um inscription:
**FEIM. ZII. GRON.**
Unlocked Shout: **Become Ethereal (Feim Zii Gron)**, mastery 0/8.
