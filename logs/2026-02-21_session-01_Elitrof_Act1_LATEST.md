## Key Events Since Start of Session
1. **Homecoming at Jorrvaskr**: Elitrof returned to the Companions; flytinged a whelp publicly over "hide the Talos amulet" talk (took Trouble compel).
2. **Sparring**: Elitrof proved his edge in a friendly bout with Vilkas + Farkas, re-establishing status in the hall.
3. **Contracts taken**: Shrine of Talos protection, Chillfurrow wolves, Pelagia giant.
4. **Talos Shrine Sting**: Harassment revealed as an identification trap for Talos worshippers.
   - **Vignar intel recorded**: named Nazeem as the mouthpiece; suspected Battle-Born backing; confirmed a Thalmor Justiciar handler present.
   - **Justiciar Varyn** escalated first (spellcasting), was subdued and **captured alive**; sustained severe injury (missing sword hand) and moderate wound (raked chest); cauterized to prevent bleed-out.
   - **Nazeem** and a **borrowed-uniform enforcer** were captured.
   - Pilgrim witnesses observed the Justiciar strike first.

## NPCs Encountered
- **Kodlak Whitemane** (Harbinger; adoptive father)
- **Skjor** (mentor, hardline)
- **Farkas & Vilkas** (shield-siblings)
- **Vignar Greymane** (storyteller; intelligence source)
- **Justiciar Varyn** (captured)
- **Nazeem** (captured)
- **Borrowed-Uniform Enforcer** (captured)
- **Pilgrims at Talos Shrine** (witnesses)

## Party Split
- **Vilkas** escorting prisoners to **Dragonsreach** to report to **Jarl Balgruuf**.
- **Elitrof + Farkas** proceeding to **Chillfurrow Farm** (wolves), then **Pelagia Farm** (giant).

## Open Threads / Pending GM Beats
- Trouble compel offered on the road (travelers approving Talos persecution) — **unresolved**.
- Balgruuf reaction: legal framing + political fallout for the captured Justiciar.
- Thalmor retaliation clock active; narrative control attempts expected.
