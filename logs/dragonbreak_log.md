# Dragonbreak Log

This file tracks all Dragonbreaks (timeline fractures) that occur during the campaign.

## What is a Dragonbreak?

A Dragonbreak is a narrative tool used when player actions irrevocably diverge from Elder Scrolls canon, creating parallel timelines where multiple contradictory truths exist simultaneously.

## Example Dragonbreak (Template)

## Dragonbreak: The Fate of Jarl Balgruuf

**Date**: 20th of Last Seed, 4E 201
**Session**: Session 3
**Cause**: Party assassinated Jarl Balgruuf in Dragonsreach during a tense negotiation gone wrong
**Canon Conflict**: Jarl Balgruuf should survive to lead Whiterun through the dragon crisis
**Resolution**: 
- Timeline A: Balgruuf died, Vignar Gray-Mane assumed control, Whiterun joined Stormcloaks
- Timeline B: Balgruuf survived, maintained neutral stance
- Going forward: NPCs have conflicting memories; Whiterun's allegiance remains ambiguous
**Affected Elements**:
- NPCs: Jarl Balgruuf, Vignar Gray-Mane, Irileth, Proventus Avenicci
- Factions: Whiterun Guard, Stormcloaks, Imperial Legion
- Quests: "Dragon Rising", "Battle for Whiterun"
**Narrative Impact**: 
- Whiterun's allegiance is now uncertain and depends on context
- Different NPCs remember different versions of events
- Future quests involving Whiterun will reference both possibilities
**World Aspect Created**: "Time Broke at Dragonsreach"
**Status**: Active
