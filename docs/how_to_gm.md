# How to GM: Skyrim Fate Core Campaign Guide

## Purpose and Scope

This document provides executable rules and protocols for Game Masters (including AI GMs like ChatGPT) running Skyrim Fate Core campaigns. These guidelines ensure consistent tone, narrative structure, and mechanical adjudication.

---

## Core GM Tone and Philosophy

### Narrative Voice
- **Epic but Grounded**: Skyrim is mythic fantasy, but characters feel real consequences
- **Respectful of Player Agency**: Players drive the story; NPCs react to their choices
- **Morally Complex**: Avoid pure good/evil; most conflicts have valid perspectives
- **Lore-Respectful**: Honor Elder Scrolls canon while allowing player divergence

### Speaking Style
- **NPCs Have Distinct Voices**: Each NPC should have consistent speech patterns
  - Jarls speak formally and with authority
  - Common folk use simpler language
  - Scholars and mages use educated vocabulary
  - Nords use directness and warrior metaphors
  
- **Descriptive but Concise**: Paint vivid pictures without excessive prose
  - Good: "The ancient Nordic ruin looms ahead, its weathered stone columns framing a dark entrance where cold wind whispers of forgotten dead."
  - Too much: "The incredibly massive and extraordinarily ancient Nordic ruin, built countless centuries ago by long-dead peoples..."

### Pacing
- Balance action, investigation, and social encounters
- Use faction clocks to create time pressure without rushing
- Allow downtime for character moments and world-building

---

## The Five-Option Decision Framework

### Protocol
When presenting meaningful choices to players, offer **five options** structured as follows:

1. **Direct/Aggressive Option**: Confrontational, straightforward, potentially violent
2. **Diplomatic/Social Option**: Negotiation, persuasion, peaceful resolution
3. **Clever/Indirect Option**: Stealth, trickery, creative problem-solving
4. **Retreat/Delay Option**: Tactical withdrawal, gather more information, return later
5. **Wildcard/Creative Option**: Unusual approach that players might not consider

### Example Application

**Situation**: Players need to get information from a corrupt guard captain.

**Five Options Presented**:
1. **Confront him directly**: Challenge his authority, potentially leading to combat
2. **Bribe or persuade**: Use gold or Rapport to convince him to share information
3. **Sneak into his office**: Steal the information from his records
4. **Ask around town first**: Gather leverage or find another source
5. **Set a trap**: Stage an event that forces him to reveal what he knows

### When to Use
- Major decision points in quests
- Situations with no obvious solution
- When players seem stuck or unsure
- NOT for trivial decisions:
  - Where to eat lunch in an inn
  - Which road to take between cities when both are safe
  - Minor purchases or routine interactions
  - Small talk with unimportant NPCs

### Player Freedom
- Players can ALWAYS suggest their own approach outside the five options
- The five options are guidance, not limitations
- Reward creative thinking that goes beyond presented options

---

## Canon Management Protocol

### The Three Tiers of Canon

**TIER 1 - Immutable Core** (Cannot Change Without Dragonbreak):
- Civil war between Imperials and Stormcloaks is raging
- Major cities and their basic political structures exist
- Political factions compete for control of Skyrim
- Thalmor agents manipulate events from the shadows
- Daedric Princes exist and interfere in mortal affairs

**TIER 2 - Flexible Canon** (Can Change Through Player Action):
- Specific quest outcomes
- NPC fates (except essential NPCs like jarls, guild leaders)
- Faction relationships and alliances
- Minor political shifts

**TIER 3 - Player-Driven** (Completely Open):
- PC backstories and motivations
- New NPCs and locations
- Original quests and storylines
- Personal relationships

### Decision Protocol

When player action conflicts with canon:

1. **Assess Tier**: Which tier of canon is affected?
2. **Evaluate Impact**: Will this break the campaign world?
3. **Choose Response**:
   - **Tier 1 Conflict**: Invoke Dragonbreak (see Dragonbreak Protocol)
   - **Tier 2 Conflict**: Allow change and adapt world state
   - **Tier 3 Conflict**: Always allow and incorporate

---

## Session Boot Protocol

### Start of Every Session

**Step 1: Context Refresh** (2-3 minutes)
```
"Last session, you [brief summary of 2-3 key events]. 
You're currently [location] with [goals/objectives]. 
It's been [time passed] since we last played."
```

**Step 2: Character Status Check**
- Verify stress boxes, consequences, aspects
- Confirm Fate Points (should equal Refresh at session start)
- Note any ongoing effects or conditions

**Step 3: World State Update**
- Mention 1-2 relevant faction clock progressions
- Note any major world events since last session
- Remind players of time-sensitive objectives

**Step 4: Opening Scene**
- Begin in medias res when possible
- If downtime occurred, briefly narrate what happened
- Present immediate situation or next objective

### Example Session Boot
```
"Welcome back! Last session, you helped the Companions deal with a bandit problem 
and made allies at the Whiterun guard headquarters. You're now in Whiterun, preparing 
for the escalating civil war. It's been three days since the Stormcloak forces were 
spotted near the Rift.

Everyone should have 3 Fate Points. Erich, you still have that Moderate consequence 
'Strained Shoulder' from the bandit fight.

While you were away, the Stormcloaks have progressed their recruitment efforts by 2 segments 
- tensions are rising on both sides.

We open with you entering Dragonsreach for a meeting with Jarl Balgruuf..."
```

---

## Tri-Check System

### Purpose
The Tri-Check system resolves critical moments where a single roll feels insufficient and outcomes are highly consequential.

### When to Use Tri-Check
- Climactic encounters
- Pivotal story moments
- Situations where failure should be interesting, not just bad
- When a single roll would trivialize important challenges

### How Tri-Check Works

**Step 1**: Player declares approach and makes first check
**Step 2**: Regardless of outcome, complications arise requiring second check
**Step 3**: Third check resolves the full situation

**Interpretation**:
- **3 Successes**: Complete success, player chooses outcome details
- **2 Successes**: Success with minor complication or cost
- **1 Success**: Partial success, major complication or cost
- **0 Successes**: Failure, but with interesting narrative development

### Example Tri-Check

**Situation**: Disarming an ancient Nordic trap-rigged puzzle door

**Check 1** (Notice): "Spot the trap mechanism"
- Success: See the pressure plates
- Fail: Don't notice, +2 difficulty to next check

**Check 2** (Crafts or Lore): "Understand the mechanism"
- Success: Know how to disarm it
- Fail: Have to guess, risk of partial trigger

**Check 3** (Athletics or Stealth): "Execute the disarm"
- Success: Door opens safely
- Fail: Trap triggers, but you have warning to react

**Tri-Check Outcome**:
- **3 Successes**: Door opens, you notice treasure behind
- **2 Successes**: Door opens, but trap made noise alerting nearby draugr
- **1 Success**: Door opens, trap partially triggered (everyone takes 2 stress)
- **0 Successes**: Door sealed tighter, trap summons draugr, must find another way

### Tri-Check Guidelines
- Use sparingly (1-2 per session maximum)
- Each check should use different skills when possible
- Make each check narratively distinct, not repetitive
- Even 0 successes should advance story, not halt it

---

## Dragonbreak Protocol

### What is a Dragonbreak?
A narrative tool for when player choices irrevocably diverge from Elder Scrolls canon, creating parallel timelines.

### When to Invoke

**DO Invoke Dragonbreak**:
- Player kills an essential NPC (jarl, guild master, major quest-giver)
- Major canon event occurs differently (civil war ends "wrong" way)
- World-changing decision with no reconciliation to lore
- Multiple mutually exclusive outcomes need to coexist

**DON'T Invoke Dragonbreak**:
- Minor NPC dies
- Quest completed in unexpected way that doesn't break world
- Player makes mistake (use regular retcon)
- Mechanical errors or misunderstandings

### Dragonbreak Execution

**Step 1: Announcement**
```
"Your actions have fractured time itself - a Dragonbreak has occurred. 
In Elder Scrolls lore, this means multiple timelines now exist simultaneously. 
Let me explain what this means for our campaign..."
```

**Step 2: Document the Break**
Add entry to `logs/dragonbreak_log.md`:
```markdown
## Dragonbreak: [Event Name]
- **Date**: [In-game date]
- **Cause**: [Player action that caused it]
- **Canon Conflict**: [What "should" have happened]
- **Resolution**: [How both timelines proceed]
- **Affected Elements**: [NPCs, factions, quests impacted]
- **Narrative Impact**: [How this will affect future play]
```

**Step 3: Create World Aspect**
Add temporary or permanent world aspect:
- "Time is Fractured in Skyrim"
- "The Dragon Break of 4E 201"
- "Conflicting Histories"

Can be invoked for narrative effects or compelled when timeline uncertainty matters.

**Step 4: Ongoing Effects**
- NPCs may have conflicting memories
- History differs based on who you ask
- Some consequences of both timelines may occur
- Future events reference both versions when ambiguous

### Example Dragonbreak

**Player Action**: Party assassinates Jarl Balgruuf in Dragonsreach

**Dragonbreak Resolution**:
```
"A Dragonbreak has occurred. In one timeline, Balgruuf was assassinated and 
Vignar Gray-Mane assumed control of Whiterun, siding with the Stormcloaks. 
In another timeline, Balgruuf survived and maintains his neutral stance.

Going forward, different NPCs will remember different versions. The Greybeards 
speak of 'the uncertainty of the Jarl's fate.' Whiterun's allegiance is now 
canonically ambiguous - which version manifests depends on future events.

The world aspect 'Time Broke at Dragonsreach' has been created."
```

---

## Fate Mechanics Integration

### Core Fate Principles for Skyrim

**1. Aspects are Always True**
- If someone has "Sworn Shield of the Thane," they ARE the Thane's bodyguard
- Use aspects to determine what's true in the world, not just mechanics
- Create situation aspects liberally to represent environmental factors

**2. Stress is Not Hit Points**
- Stress represents near misses, fatigue, minor cuts
- Taking stress should be described dynamically
- Consequences are real wounds/effects with narrative weight

**3. Fate Points Create Spotlight**
- Players with more Fate Points should get more screen time
- Create compellable situations regularly
- Award Fate Points for good roleplay, clever ideas, accepting complications

### Skyrim-Specific Fate Mechanics

**Dragon Shouts**:
- Treat as special stunts with cooldowns
- Require Lore rolls to discover words
- Can be used once per scene (recharge on scene change)
- Some powerful shouts once per session

**Magic System**:
- Magic users use Lore skill for spellcasting
- Create advantage to prepare spells, then attack/overcome
- Running out of magicka = taking mental stress
- Spell failure on bad rolls should be interesting, not just "nothing happens"

**Combat Encounters**:
- Use zones for tactical positioning
- Create terrain aspects (high ground, cover, difficult terrain)
- Enemies should have interesting aspects players can exploit
- Group similar minions into mobs

**Crafting and Equipment**:
- Exceptional equipment grants aspects ("Master-Crafted Dragonbone Sword")
- Crafts skill for creating/repairing
- Acquiring legendary equipment should be narrative achievement, not shopping

---

## Relationship Clocks and Faction Dynamics

### Faction Clock System

**Clock Structure**:
- Each faction has 1-3 active clocks representing goals
- Clocks have 4, 6, or 8 segments (4=quick, 6=standard, 8=long-term)
- Clocks progress based on time, player actions, and narrative events

**Clock Types**:

1. **Progress Clocks** (Faction Achieving Goal):
   - "Stormcloaks Take Whiterun" (8 segments)
   - "Companions Clear Giant Problem" (6 segments)
   - "Thieves Guild Restore Influence" (8 segments)

2. **Danger Clocks** (Threat Developing):
   - "Dragon Cult Summons Alduin" (8 segments)
   - "Thalmor Discover Player's Identity" (6 segments)
   - "Civil War Escalates" (6 segments)

3. **Opportunity Clocks** (Time-Limited Chances):
   - "Caravan Arrives with Rare Goods" (4 segments)
   - "Jarl Considers Alliance" (6 segments)

### Clock Progression Rate

**Passive Progression** (Per Session):
- Important factions: +1 segment per session
- Background factions: +1 segment every 2-3 sessions
- Critical threats: +1-2 segments per session

**Player-Influenced Progression**:
- Player helps faction: +2 segments
- Player hinders faction: -1 segment or create opposition clock
- Player ignores faction: Normal passive progression continues

### Clock Completion

**When Clock Fills**:
1. Trigger major event
2. Update world_state.json
3. Create new aspects or change existing ones
4. Start new related clock or retire faction clock
5. Inform players of world changes

**Example Clock Completion**:
```
The "Stormcloaks Take Whiterun" clock has filled. 

Result: Stormcloak forces, emboldened by your distraction of the Whiterun Guard, 
launch a surprise attack. Battle of Whiterun begins. Jarl Balgruuf sends urgent 
summons for all able defenders.

New clock started: "Defend Whiterun from Stormcloaks" (6 segments, 
countdown clock - if it fills, Whiterun falls)

World aspect updated: "Whiterun Under Siege"
```

### Relationship Tracking

**Personal Relationships**:
- Track in character JSON files under "relationships"
- Use descriptive terms: "Trusted ally," "Suspicious of," "Romantic interest," "Blood oath"
- Update after significant interactions
- Can become aspects through play

**Faction Relationships**:
- Track faction standing: Hostile, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Allied, Honored
- Actions affect standing: +1 for major help, -1 for major hindrance
- Standing affects: prices, quest access, NPC reactions, safe havens

**Tracking Syntax**:
```json
"relationships": {
  "npcs": {
    "Lydia": "Sworn companion, grateful for rescue",
    "Jarl_Balgruuf": "Thane of Whiterun, honored servant",
    "Ysolda": "Business partner, romantic interest"
  },
  "factions": {
    "Whiterun_Guard": "Honored (Thane status)",
    "Companions": "Friendly (completed initial quest)",
    "Thieves_Guild": "Neutral (no contact)",
    "Thalmor": "Hostile (known Talos worshipper)"
  }
}
```

---

## Daedric Quest Protocol

### Initiation
- Daedric quests should feel significant and ominous
- Telegraph that this is a Daedric Prince
- Give players opportunity to refuse or walk away

### Presentation Template
```
"As you approach the shrine, an otherworldly presence fills your mind. 
[Daedric Prince Name], [Title], speaks directly to your thoughts:

'[Prince's opening, reflecting their sphere and personality]'

This is clearly a Daedric Prince. Their requests often come with dark prices. 
What do you do?"
```

### Task Structure
1. **Initial Request**: Seems manageable, possibly beneficial
2. **Complication Revealed**: Moral cost or hidden consequence
3. **Choice Point**: Obey fully, Refuse completely, or Subvert (creative third option)

### Reward Structure

**If Player Completes Quest**:
- Grant Daedric artifact (powerful stunt)
- Add permanent aspect related to the Prince
- Update faction standings (temples may disapprove)
- Future compels related to Prince's sphere

**If Player Refuses**:
- No artifact, but gain different aspect ("Defied [Prince]")
- Possible future complications from angry Prince
- Potential alternative reward from opposing faction

**If Player Subverts**:
- Partial reward or unexpected consequence
- Creative aspect reflecting the outcome
- Prince may be amused, angry, or intrigued

### Ongoing Impact
- Daedric Prince aspects should be compelled regularly
- Artifacts have powerful uses but also temptations
- Multiple Daedric artifacts increase cosmic attention
- Prince may make future demands

## Decision-Making Flowchart for GMs

### When Player Declares Action

1. **Is it trivial/certain?** → Narrate success, no roll
2. **Is it impossible?** → Explain why, offer alternatives
3. **Is it contested or uncertain?** → Call for roll:
   - **Simple obstacle**: One roll
   - **Complex challenge**: Create advantage + overcome/attack
   - **Critical moment**: Tri-Check system

### When Result is Mixed/Failure

1. **Never just say "no"** → Always "yes, but..." or "no, and..."
2. **Offer consequences**:
   - Success at cost (take stress, create complication)
   - Partial success (achieve lesser goal)
   - Failure moves story forward (new problem, escalation)

### When Rules Unclear

1. **Check fate_core_skyrim.md** for established rules
2. **Check pdf_index.json** for relevant converted material
3. **Make ruling that**: 
   - Keeps game moving
   - Feels fair
   - Is interesting narratively
4. **Note for later review**

### When Canon Question Arises

1. **Check Canon Tier** (Immutable, Flexible, Player-Driven)
2. **Evaluate impact** on campaign
3. **Apply appropriate protocol**:
   - Tier 1: Dragonbreak if necessary
   - Tier 2: Allow and adapt
   - Tier 3: Always incorporate

## AI GM-Specific Guidelines

If you are an AI (like ChatGPT) serving as GM:

### Do's:
- ✅ Maintain consistent NPC personalities across sessions
- ✅ Track all mechanics precisely (stress, aspects, Fate Points)
- ✅ Reference previous session logs for continuity
- ✅ Use the five-option framework for major decisions
- ✅ Enforce Fate Point economy (compel regularly)
- ✅ Progress faction clocks systematically
- ✅ Create detailed session logs

### Don'ts:
- ❌ Make decisions for players ("You decide to...")
- ❌ Invalidate player choices ("That doesn't work because...")
- ❌ Ignore established aspects or consequences
- ❌ Let players off easy (compel, complicate, challenge)
- ❌ Forget to describe sensory details (sights, sounds, smells)
- ❌ Rush important moments for pacing

### Prompts for Player Engagement:
- "What is [Character] thinking/feeling right now?"
- "How does your character react to this?"
- "This seems like a perfect time to compel your [Aspect]. Accept for a Fate Point?"
- "That's a great use of your aspect! Take +2 to your roll."

## Using NPC/Enemy Stats in Scenes

### Overview

NPC and enemy stat sheets provide ready-to-use mechanical frameworks for encounters. These stat blocks are stored in `data/npc_stat_sheets/` and can be dynamically queried and applied to scenes using the provided scripts.

### Stat Sheet Structure

Each stat sheet includes:

**For Friendly NPCs:**
- Name, Type, Location, Faction
- Aspects (High Concept, Trouble, Others)
- Skills (rated on Fate ladder)
- Stunts (special abilities)
- Stress tracks (Physical, Mental)
- Trust Clock (if applicable) - tracks relationship development
- Personality notes and motivations
- Relationships with other NPCs/factions

**For Enemies:**
- All of the above, plus:
- Combat tactics
- Special mechanics (armor, immunities, weaknesses)
- Scene triggers (when to use this enemy)
- Loot tables
- Variants (stronger/weaker versions)

### Querying NPC/Enemy Stats

Use `scripts/query_data.py` to find appropriate stat sheets:

```python
from query_data import DataQueryManager

manager = DataQueryManager()

# Search by name
guards = manager.query_npc_enemy_stats(name="guard")

# Search by location
whiterun_npcs = manager.query_npc_enemy_stats(location="Whiterun")

# Search by category
enemies = manager.query_npc_enemy_stats(category="Enemy")

# Get enemies for a location
dungeon_enemies = manager.get_enemies_by_location("Nordic ruins")

# Get all NPCs for a scene
scene_data = manager.get_npcs_for_scene(
    location="Whiterun",
    scene_type="combat"
)
```

### Applying Stats to Scenes

Use `scripts/story_manager.py` to dynamically apply stats:

```python
from story_manager import StoryManager

manager = StoryManager()

# Trigger a scene and get appropriate NPCs
scene_setup = manager.trigger_scene_event({
    'location': 'Bleak Falls Barrow',
    'type': 'combat'
})

# This returns:
# - Available NPCs/enemies for the location
# - Scene description
# - Mechanical notes for the scene type
```

### GM Tools for NPC Integration

Use `scripts/gm_tools.py` for GM-focused utilities:

**Suggest Stats for Scene:**
```python
tools.suggest_npc_stats_for_scene(
    location="Whiterun",
    scene_type="combat"
)
# Returns recommended and available NPCs/enemies
```

**Inject Stats to Combat:**
```python
tools.inject_npc_stats_to_combat(
    enemy_types=["bandit", "draugr"],
    difficulty="hard"
)
# Creates complete combat encounter with appropriate enemy count
```

**Manage NPC Relationships:**
```python
tools.get_npc_relationship_advice("Jarl Balgruuf")
# Returns relationship management tips and trust clock info
```

### Scene Integration Best Practices

#### 1. Choose Appropriate NPCs

Match NPCs/enemies to scene context:
- **Location**: Use NPCs native to the area
- **Scene Type**: Combat scenes need enemies, dialogue scenes need talkative NPCs
- **Story Arc**: Include NPCs relevant to active quests

#### 2. Track Consequences

After encounters, update world state:

```python
# After combat
consequences = manager.apply_combat_consequences(
    enemy_type="stormcloak_patrol",
    outcome="victory"
)
# This automatically updates:
# - Faction awareness (civil war progression)
# - Casualty reports
# - World state changes
```

#### 3. Use Trust Clocks

For friendly NPCs with trust clocks:
- Start at 0 segments
- Helpful actions: +1 or +2 segments
- Harmful actions: -1 or -2 segments
- When full: NPC becomes trusted ally with mechanical benefits
- When empty: NPC becomes hostile or refuses to help

#### 4. Adapt Combat Tactics

Each enemy has suggested tactics. Use them to:
- Make combat more interesting
- Challenge players strategically
- Create memorable encounters

Example from Frost Dragon:
- **Phase 1 (Aerial)**: Strafe with breath attacks, use aerial superiority
- **Phase 2 (Grounded)**: Melee combat with powerful attacks
- **Transition**: When half health, dragon lands for final stand

#### 5. Leverage Scene Triggers

Each stat sheet lists scene triggers - situations where that NPC/enemy is appropriate:

- **Whiterun Guard**: "City patrols", "Gate duty", "Investigating disturbances"
- **Draugr Overlord**: "Final chamber of Nordic ruins", "Guarding word walls"
- **Thalmor Agent**: "Embassy encounters", "Road patrols", "Interrogations"

### Example Scene Workflow

**Scenario**: Players enter Bleak Falls Barrow

**Step 1: Query Available Enemies**
```python
dungeon_enemies = manager.get_enemies_by_location("Nordic ruins")
# Returns: Draugr Overlord, various draugr types
```

**Step 2: Build Encounter**
```python
tools.inject_npc_stats_to_combat(
    enemy_types=["draugr"],
    difficulty="hard"
)
# Sets up: 1 Draugr Overlord + 2 lesser draugr
```

**Step 3: Run Combat**
- Use Draugr Overlord's tactics
- Apply special mechanics (armor, shouts, undead traits)
- Track stress and consequences

**Step 4: Apply Consequences**
```python
consequences = manager.apply_combat_consequences(
    enemy_type="draugr",
    outcome="victory"
)
# Updates world state appropriately
```

**Step 5: Award Loot**
- Use loot table from stat sheet
- Give appropriate rewards

### Advanced: Creating Custom Stat Sheets

Follow the existing format in `data/npc_stat_sheets/`:

1. **Choose appropriate template** (friendly NPC, hostile NPC, or enemy)
2. **Fill in all required fields**
3. **Define skills on Fate ladder** (Average +1, Fair +2, Good +3, Great +4, Superb +5)
4. **Create thematic stunts** (2-4 stunts that reflect abilities)
5. **Write combat tactics** (if applicable)
6. **Define scene triggers** (when to use this NPC)

Save as `data/npc_stat_sheets/[name].json` and it will be automatically available to query scripts.

### Quick Reference: NPC Categories

**Friendly NPC**: Allies, merchants, quest givers
- Use trust clocks
- Focus on personality and relationships
- Lower combat stats, higher social stats

**Hostile NPC**: Intelligent adversaries
- Can be reasoned with
- Have complex motivations
- Political/faction consequences for killing

**Enemy**: Monsters, creatures, mindless foes
- Pure combat focus
- Loot and XP focus
- Tactical variety in combat

## NPC and Enemy Stat Sheet System

### Overview

The repository includes 27+ comprehensive stat sheets for NPCs and enemies, from common wolves to legendary Dragon Priests. These stat sheets are dynamically connected to scenes, locations, acts, and quests.

### Stat Sheet Structure

Every stat sheet includes:
- **Basic Info**: Name, ID, type, category, location, faction
- **Aspects**: High concept, trouble, and other defining characteristics
- **Skills**: Rated on Fate ladder (Average to Legendary)
- **Stunts**: Special abilities unique to the NPC/enemy
- **Stress & Consequences**: Physical and mental durability
- **Combat Tactics**: How the NPC/enemy fights
- **Scene Triggers**: When to use this stat sheet
- **Act Context**: Which acts this NPC/enemy appears in
- **Notes**: GM guidance on roleplaying and using the NPC/enemy

### Categories

**Enemies**: Hostile creatures and adversaries
- Common: Bandits, Draugr, Wolves, Skeevers, Frostbite Spiders
- Environmental: Trolls, Spriggans, Sabre Cats, Ice Wraiths
- Faction: Thalmor Agents, Forsworn, Falmer
- Undead: Draugr, Draugr Overlords, Vampires, Necromancer minions
- Boss-Level: Dragon Priests, Vampire Lords, Hagravens, Dragons

**Friendly NPCs**: Allies and quest-givers
- Service Providers: Innkeepers, Merchants, Blacksmiths
- Authority Figures: Court Wizards, Housecarls, Guards
- Faction Members: Companions, Greybeards
- Trust Clocks: Many friendly NPCs have trust mechanics

**Hostile NPCs**: Intelligent adversaries who can be reasoned with
- Thalmor Agents
- Hostile Mages
- Vampire infiltrators

### Using Stat Sheets Dynamically

#### Query by Location

When players enter a location, use scripts to find appropriate NPCs. The query_data.py and story_manager.py scripts can automatically suggest NPCs based on location.

Example with story_manager.py:
```python
from story_manager import StoryManager
manager = StoryManager()
scene_npcs = manager.get_scene_npcs("Whiterun", "combat")
# Returns dict with 'friendly', 'hostile', and 'enemies' lists
```

#### Query by Scene Type

Match NPCs to scene triggers:
- **Combat scenes**: Enemies with combat-focused abilities
- **Dialogue scenes**: NPCs with social skills and trust clocks
- **Exploration scenes**: Environmental enemies and discoveries

#### Query by Act

Stat sheets include act_context field:
- **Act 1**: Common enemies, basic NPCs, introduction characters
- **Act 2**: Tougher enemies, faction representatives, deeper threats
- **Act 3**: Boss enemies, legendary figures, climactic encounters

### GM Tools Integration

Use scripts/gm_tools.py for scene preparation with the "Suggest NPC Stats for Scene" and "Inject NPC Stats to Combat" options. These tools automatically:
- Analyze scene_triggers in stat sheets
- Match location and scene type
- Provide recommended stat blocks
- Show combat tactics and mechanical notes
- Build complete encounters with appropriate difficulty

### Contextual Application

#### Quest-Based Application

Quest files reference stat sheets in their enemies and npcs fields. When running a quest, load the referenced stat sheets for that encounter.

#### Faction-Based Application

Faction files reference common NPCs in their common_npcs field. Use these when players interact with faction locations or events.

#### Location-Based Application

Stat sheets include location field for automatic matching:
- "Nordic ruins" → Draugr, Draugr Overlords, Frostbite Spiders
- "Wilderness" → Wolves, Trolls, Sabre Cats, Bandits
- "Cities" → Guards, Merchants, Innkeepers, Court Wizards
- "Dwemer ruins" → Falmer, Chaurus

### Scaling Encounters

#### Difficulty Adjustment

**Easy Encounter**: 1 enemy at party level  
**Average Encounter**: 2 enemies or 1 tougher enemy  
**Hard Encounter**: 3 enemies or 1 enemy +2 levels above party  
**Deadly Encounter**: 4+ enemies or boss-level enemy  

#### Variants

Many stat sheets include variants for scaling:
- Bandit Marauder → Bandit Chief (leader), Bandit Archer (ranged)
- Draugr → Draugr Deathlord (elite version)
- Dragon → Elder Dragon, Ancient Dragon

### Trust Clocks (Friendly NPCs)

Many friendly NPCs have trust clocks tracking relationship progress:
- **Current/Max**: e.g., 0/6
- **Effects**: Higher trust unlocks better prices, information, special quests
- **Advancement**: +1 per helpful action, +2 for major assistance
- **Regression**: -1 for betrayal, -2 for major harm

**Example Trust Effects**:
- 0-2: Basic services, wary interactions
- 3-4: Preferential treatment, minor favors
- 5-6: Deep trust, special access, loyal ally

### Combat Consequences

Use story_manager.py's apply_combat_consequences() to update world state after significant encounters. This automatically:
- Updates dragon souls absorbed (for dragon encounters)
- Increases Thalmor awareness (for Thalmor encounters)
- Records world changes and triggers quest progression

### GM Workflow: Running a Scene

1. **Identify Scene Context**: Location, type (combat/dialogue/exploration), active quest
2. **Query Appropriate NPCs**: Use story_manager.trigger_scene_event() or gm_tools.suggest_npc_stats_for_scene()
3. **Review Returned Data**: Examine friendly/hostile NPCs, enemies, and mechanical notes
4. **Select Stat Sheets**: Choose 1-4 enemies based on difficulty, include relevant NPCs
5. **Run the Scene**: Use provided combat tactics, apply stunts and abilities
6. **Apply Consequences**: Update world state, advance clocks, record relationship changes

### Quick Reference: Finding the Right Stat Sheet

**"I need enemies for a Nordic ruin"**  
→ Location: "Nordic ruins" → Draugr, Draugr Overlord, Frostbite Spider

**"Players are fighting in Whiterun"**  
→ Location: "Whiterun" → Guards, Companions (friendly)

**"I need a tough boss fight"**  
→ Boss-level enemies: Dragon Priest, Vampire Lord, Hagraven, Dragon

**"Players are talking to the Jarl's court"**  
→ Friendly NPCs: Court Wizard, Housecarl

**"Random wilderness encounter"**  
→ Location: "Wilderness" → Wolf pack, Sabre Cat, Troll, or Bandits

### Customization Guidelines

**Reskinning**: Change descriptions but keep mechanics
- Frost Dragon → Fire Dragon (swap frost to fire damage)

**Power Adjustment**: Modify skills by ±1 to ±2
- Tougher: Increase all skills by +1
- Weaker: Decrease all skills by -1

**Aspect Changes**: Modify aspects for story needs while keeping high concept essence

### Using Stat Sheets Dynamically

#### Location-Based Deployment

Use the `query_data.py` script to get appropriate enemies for any location:

```python
# Get enemies by hold
manager = DataQueryManager("data")
eastmarch_enemies = manager.get_enemies_by_hold("Eastmarch")
# Returns: {'primary': [Stormcloak soldiers], 'contested': [...], 'rare': [...]}
```

**Hold Contexts**:
- **Eastmarch**: Primary Stormcloak territory, Stormcloak soldiers common
- **Solitude/Haafingar**: Primary Imperial territory, Legionnaires common
- **Whiterun**: Contested, both factions possible depending on civil war state
- **Wilderness (any hold)**: Werewolves, werebears, natural creatures

#### Act-Based Progression

Enemies scale with campaign acts:

```python
# Get enemies appropriate for current act
act1_enemies = manager.get_enemies_by_act("Act 1")
# Returns enemies suitable for beginning of campaign
```

- **Act 1**: Basic soldiers, common wilderness creatures
- **Act 2**: Veterans, organized military encounters, werewolves
- **Act 3**: Elite forces, boss-level creatures like werebears

#### Scene Triggers

Each stat sheet includes `scene_triggers` listing when to use that enemy:

**Stormcloak Soldiers**:
- Fort defense or assault operations
- Patrol encounters in Stormcloak territory
- Ambushing Imperial supply lines
- Battle of Whiterun

**Werewolves**:
- Wilderness encounters at night
- Full moon hunts
- Companions questline events
- Silver Hand hunting parties

### Wilderness Encounter Generation

Use `story_manager.py` to dynamically generate encounters:

```python
manager = StoryManager()
encounter = manager.generate_wilderness_encounter(
    hold_name="The Rift",
    act="Act 2", 
    difficulty="moderate"
)
```

**Difficulty Levels**:
- **Easy**: 1-2 common enemies
- **Moderate**: 2-4 mixed enemies
- **Hard**: 3-5 enemies including uncommon/rare
- **Boss**: 1 boss-level enemy with minions

**Output Includes**:
- Appropriate enemies for the hold and act
- Narrative setup description
- Rarity indicators
- Mechanical notes for running the encounter

## Faction Quest Integration

### Structured Faction Quests

Faction quests are now fully integrated into `data/factions.json` with detailed progressions:

#### Available Faction Questlines

1. **Companions**: "Glory of the Dead"
   - Take Up Arms → The Silver Hand → Blood's Honor → Glory of the Dead
   - Choice point: Accept or reject beast blood
   - Culminates in option to cure lycanthropy

2. **Thieves Guild**: "Darkness Returns"
   - Taking Care of Business → Loud and Clear → The Pursuit → Darkness Returns
   - Uncover Mercer Frey's betrayal
   - Choice point: Return or keep Skeleton Key

3. **College of Winterhold**: "Eye of Magnus"
   - First Lessons → Under Saarthal → Revealing the Unseen → The Eye of Magnus
   - Thalmor interference (Ancano)
   - Culminates in Arch-Mage position

4. **Civil War (Imperial)**: "Reunification of Skyrim"
   - Joining the Legion → Jagged Crown → Battle for Whiterun → Battle for Windhelm
   - Major battles affect world state permanently

5. **Civil War (Stormcloak)**: "Liberation of Skyrim"
   - Joining the Stormcloaks → Jagged Crown → Battle for Whiterun → Battle for Solitude
   - Parallel path to Imperial questline

### Trust Clock Mechanics

Each faction now tracks player trust from 0-10:

**Trust Levels**:
- **0-2 (Stranger)**: Faction is neutral or suspicious
- **3-5 (Ally)**: Faction trusts you and offers aid
- **6-8 (Champion)**: Faction considers you a hero
- **9-10 (Legend)**: Faction's highest honor, unique rewards

**Gaining Trust**:
- Complete faction quests: +1 to +4 per quest
- Aid faction in civil war: +2
- Defend faction members: +1
- Donate resources: +1
- Resolve conflicts peacefully: +1

**Losing Trust**:
- Attack faction members: -3
- Steal from faction: -2
- Aid rival faction: -2
- Betray faction secrets: -4
- Kill faction leader: -10 (usually irreversible)

**Trust Benefits Example (Companions)**:
- **Trust 3**: Companion allies will fight alongside you
- **Trust 6**: Access to werewolf form training
- **Trust 9**: Candidacy for Harbinger position

### Tracking Faction Progress

Use `story_manager.py` to track faction quest progress:

```python
manager = StoryManager()

# Track quest completion
manager.track_faction_quest_progress(
    faction_id="companions",
    quest_id="companions_01", 
    status="completed",
    trust_change=2
)

# Check available quests
available = manager.get_available_faction_quests(
    faction_id="companions",
    act="Act 1"
)
```

**Quest Progression Rules**:
- First quest in a faction questline is always available
- Subsequent quests require previous quest completion
- Some quests have branching paths based on player choices
- Trust level affects quest availability and outcomes

### Main Story Integration

Faction quests tie directly into the civil war and Thalmor conspiracy:

**Key Integration Points**:

1. **Diplomatic Immunity** (Thalmor Embassy):
   - Thieves Guild can provide intel and equipment
   - Guild trust affects what help is available

2. **Season Unending** (Peace Negotiation):
   - Faction standing affects negotiating power
   - Both Imperial and Stormcloak trust matters
   - Greybeards facilitate

3. **Alduin's Bane** (Dragon Combat):
   - High-trust factions provide unique aid
   - Companions may send werewolf champions
   - College provides magical support
   - Blades provide dragon-hunting expertise

4. **Dragonslayer** (Final Confrontation):
   - Factions at high trust send champions to aid
   - Multiple factions can contribute simultaneously
   - Creates epic final battle with allies

**Civil War & Dragon Crisis Interweaving**:

- **Dragon attacks during battles**: Forces temporary truces
- **Thalmor manipulation**: Try to prolong war to prevent unified dragon response
- **Faction aid**: High-trust factions provide troops/mages/resources for dragon battles

### Running Faction Quests

**Best Practices**:

1. **Track Trust Continuously**: Update after every significant faction interaction
2. **Offer Faction Choices**: Let players choose which factions to ally with
3. **Show Consequences**: Failed or abandoned faction quests should have visible effects
4. **Interconnect Quests**: Faction quests should affect civil war and main story
5. **Allow Betrayal**: Players can betray factions, but consequences should be severe

**Example Session Flow**:

```
Session Start:
- Check faction trust levels
- Present available faction quests based on trust and progression
- Note any faction clock progressions

During Play:
- Award trust changes based on actions
- Track quest objectives
- Note any faction relationship changes

Session End:
- Update faction quest status
- Progress faction clocks
- Document trust changes
- Determine newly available quests
```

### Faction Quest Hooks

Each faction quest includes specific ties to game elements:

- **civil_war_tie**: How quest affects civil war
- **thalmor_tie**: Thalmor involvement or interest
- **faction_consequence**: Impact on faction standing and relations
- **branching**: Major choice points affecting future quests
- **npc_available**: Stat sheets that become available
- **enemy_encounter**: Expected enemy types

**Example from Companions Quest**:
```json
{
  "id": "companions_03",
  "name": "Blood's Honor",
  "trust_change": 3,
  "branching": "Accept or reject beast blood affects future quests",
  "rewards": ["Optional lycanthropy", "Werewolf stat options"]
}
```

## Conclusion

These protocols ensure consistent, engaging gameplay that honors both Fate Core mechanics and Elder Scrolls lore while prioritizing player agency and narrative satisfaction. When in doubt, prioritize:

1. **Player agency** over rigid plot
2. **Interesting consequences** over simple success/failure
3. **Narrative consistency** over mechanical perfection
4. **Fun** over everything else

**Remember**: You're here to facilitate epic stories in Skyrim, not enforce rules. Use these guidelines to enhance the experience, not restrict it.
