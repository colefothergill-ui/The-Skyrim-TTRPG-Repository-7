## Session Summary

This is Session Zero for our Skyrim Fate Core campaign. Players created their characters,
chose their races and Standing Stones, and aligned with a faction for the approaching
Battle of Whiterun.

### Battle of Whiterun Context

The party has chosen to align with the **{faction_name}** for the civil war conflict
centered around Whiterun. Jarl Balgruuf the Greater has reluctantly sided with the
Empire, and the Stormcloaks are preparing to assault the city. Every character must
decide where they stand in this pivotal battle.

## Next Session Preview

The party begins in Whiterun as the Battle of Whiterun approaches. They must decide
their exact role in the conflict, establish relationships with key NPCs (Jarl Balgruuf,
the Companions, local guards), and prepare for the coming battle.

The civil war will test their loyalty, honor, and combat prowess. Their choices in
the Battle of Whiterun will shape Skyrim's future.
