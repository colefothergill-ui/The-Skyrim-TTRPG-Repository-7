Whiterun Location Triggers

This module handles location-based triggers for Whiterun and its districts.
It provides contextual events, NPC interactions, and companion commentary
specific to Whiterun Hold.  When the Battle of Whiterun is active, district
text and companion barks switch to siege context keyed to the current stage.
