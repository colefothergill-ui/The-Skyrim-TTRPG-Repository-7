  "summary": "Corrected College of Winterhold trust from 2 (basic member) to 5 (Adept baseline) to reflect Oskern's established status as an Adept at the College, not a new initiate.",
  "canon_reference": [
    "data/pcs/pc_oskern_cindershroud.json -> aspects.other_aspects[0] == 'Adept of the College of Winterhold'",
    "data/pcs/pc_oskern_cindershroud.json -> backstory mentions 'Adept of the College of Winterhold at 23'",
    "data/clocks/faction_trust_clocks.json -> trust_benefits.5 == 'Command small units, Intel, Safe passage'"
  ],
  "rationale": "The PC is not joining the College for the first time - he's already an established Adept with standing. Trust level 2 represents basic membership (first join), while level 5 represents an Ally with established rapport and privileges. This correction aligns the trust clock with the PC's canonical status in the backstory and aspects.",
