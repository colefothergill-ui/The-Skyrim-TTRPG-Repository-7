## Character Creation Rules

1. During Session Zero, player characters MUST choose one Standing Stone
2. The choice should be recorded in the character's aspects or noted in their background
3. Standing Stones can be changed during play by visiting the physical location in-game
4. When changing stones, the character loses the previous blessing and gains the new one
5. Include the stone blessing in character planning and milestone advancement

## GM Guidelines

- **Standing Stones as Plot Devices**: Use them as landmarks, quest locations, or places of power
- **Mythic Significance**: Ancient Nordic magic, potentially tied to larger plots
- **Limit Changes**: Changing stones should require travel and be narratively significant
- **Balance**: Each stone provides situational benefit, not constant power boost
